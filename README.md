JWT(Json Web Token) is one of the most popular ways to implement authentication and role-based authorization in WebAPI Projects. It uses claims and manage your security.


we create a new .Net 8 WebAPI project from scratch and implement Fully authentication and authorization in it. We use these packages:

- "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Authentication.JwtBearer"
- "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Identity.EntityFrameworkCore"
- "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer"
- "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools"



  We also cover a lot of features and techniques like:
Dtos
